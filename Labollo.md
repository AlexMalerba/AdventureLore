Labollo is a boy who lives in a small house near a kingdom called Alpha. He is the son of a family of blacksmiths, and his dream is to become a knight and explore the world.

His parents were against his decision to become a knight, fearing that he might get hurt. So, with the little experience he had, he managed to create a small stone sword to participate in the selection of new apprentice knights at the castle.
