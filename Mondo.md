The world is divided into five kingdoms: Humans, Fairies, Ice Golems, Fire Creatures, and Demons. In the past, the world existed without the fear of being killed by demons, and all races coexisted in serenity. However, one day, strange creatures known as 'Demons' emerged, initially not perceived as a threat to the world. Eventually, with their power, they managed to conquer most kingdoms, unleashing chaos. Fearing extermination, most kingdoms formed alliances.

Interestingly, the only kingdom that resisted forging alliances was that of humans. Despite being the weakest race, they successfully countered these dark creatures, if only temporarily. The reason they resisted submission was their knowledge of a legend concerning a legendary sword capable of defeating any living creature. However, the sword met its demise when an old sorcerer, concerned about its misuse, shattered it. The fragments were then distributed among the various kingdoms, marking a pivotal moment in the struggle against the demonic threat.
